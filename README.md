# drag

This program runs on an Apache server and allows for multiple trials sorting a set of images.

It will output a text file with subject numbers, time spent on each trial, then a dictionary of image coordinates, which can then be post-processed into distances. The file paths will need updating. This can run locally on most machines if you remove any php.
